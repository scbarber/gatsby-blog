Friday has come to a close. My body is showing signs of prolonged elevated stress, which worries me. The deadline I thought I had was but a figment of my imagination, allowing me some breathing room to get things done right. The bills were paid, and I learned I made a mistake last month that I regret.

## Fear & Severance
I was in no fit state the day I found out I was losing my job. That was a day I’ll likely never forget, though I’d like to. It was unexpected news, and I wanted to remain in denial. It couldn’t be happening to me, not when I had been pouring out so much of myself into my job that my co-workers were telling me I needed a vacation. I was in shock for a good long time. Even though I immediately started sending out applications, I didn’t want to acknowledge I was losing my job; I was too afraid, and I hate to admit it, but the fear was entirely irrational; I didn’t have the emotional/mental stability to weather more bad news, so I did nothing. Consequently, I didn’t talk with my bosses about the severance situation.

Of the two other times I was actually laid off, the most recent one offered me a severance package (the first time was so long ago, and so traumatic, that I do not recall if there was a severance package, but something tells me there was a small one). That time they redeemed my unspent vacation time, which softened the blow and was quite a substantial help during my probationary period on the new job. I made an assumption: I assumed that my five years of loyal and hard working service would be rewarded with more than just a final paycheck. I was wrong.

## Time Off
I had reached a point where I was accruing two days of PTO each month. I had spent nearly all of it for Christmas, and lost track of time, because by May I had replenished quite a bit of time off. I’m generally in good health, so the PTO is usually spent having fun, rather than recuperating. My plan was to take two weeks off and spend at least half of that time working on the remodel of our basement (which is my office, library, our game room, and our media room). Honestly, I had lost track of how much PTO I had, so I didn’t say anything about it, and I assume what little I had they’d cash out, and if they didn’t it wouldn’t be a big loss. Mistake number two: I had nearly three weeks of PTO stored up.

Because I paid our bills today, I checked on the direct deposit and it was no larger than any other month. There was no severance, just my final paycheck. I worked a full final month, working hard right up to the end, and lost three weeks of paid time off. Please excuse me while I call myself a loser and wallow in a bout of self-pity.

## Lesson
There are a couple of lessons I need to learn from this. The first, and most embarrassing, is to stop making assumptions. I’m notorious for telling people that software bugs exist because of an unchecked assumption. I’m routinely instructing my children to check their assumptions. I didn’t, and I lost out. The second, and this is harder to put into practice, is to face the fear and speak up. Had I asked about severance and PTO in that first week, I would have found out I was going to lose my PTO, and I would have followed up with a vacation request for the last half of May. Not that I would have actually enjoyed the time off, and I may not have landed the contract work I’ve had this week, but still, I should have said something. The third lesson is the most heartbreaking: I shouldn’t blindly trust any company to look out for me. No matter how much goodwill the people I work with extend toward me, that doesn't mean the company itself will have my best interests at heart. Indeed, they have a responsibility to their shareholders to say nothing of the other employees.

## The Weekend
I’m heading into the weekend feeling a tad numb. I’m in a better mood than previous days, but I’m not exactly brimming with hope and good cheer. I worked up the courage to pay the bills today and was pleasantly surprised to find enough of a remainder to cover the next mortgage payment! Assuming nothing goes awry with this contract work we should do okay this month, though I am hoping (or am I wishing?) I’ll land a job before July. I hope to sleep, and nap, and rest this weekend. Our entire family is signed up for our library’s summer reading program, and I can’t think of a better way of spending my weekend than reading some good books (yep, plural). I’m sure we’ll take some breaks to play some games as a family too.
