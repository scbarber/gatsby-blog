title: "T-Minus Two Days: What Do I Want?"
description: "Today, my thoughts turned to a topic I don’t often visit. There is a flurry of mental activity in this Between Time. I’ve used the term “decompress” in times like this, times when the pattern of my life might, or will, change. I’m mildly amused to note that my life did change on the first of this month, but it wasn’t until a new income stream was secured that my mind was free to process the changes. I had a life with a group of people, in a particular culture, working on a specific product, doing it in a mode we all agreed upon; that life is over. Now I face a new life with a new group of people, with a new culture, a new product, and probably new modes of work. In some ways it feels like a fresh start and that got me wondering what I want."

Today, my thoughts turned to a topic I don’t often visit. There is a flurry of mental activity in this Between Time. I’ve used the term “decompress” in times like this, times when the pattern of my life might, or will, change. I’m mildly amused to note that my life did change on the first of this month, but it wasn’t until a new income stream was secured that my mind was free to process the changes. I had a life with a group of people, in a particular culture, working on a specific product, doing it in a mode we all agreed upon; that life is over. Now I face a new life with a new group of people, with a new culture, a new product, and probably new modes of work. In some ways it feels like a fresh start and that got me wondering what I want.

# Pattern of Life

This morning I started to think about the pattern of my life and began to wonder what changes I would like to make upon it. Maybe it’s a function of Asperger’s Syndrome, but I haven’t really asked this question of myself. Until now, I’ve never considered that I could have a direct impact upon the pattern of my life. It’s always been something I’ve observed, noted, and analyzed, but not something I felt I could guide, direct, or determine.

There was a time in my teens, when I did some street witnessing with my church. In preparation for that we talked about various ways of presenting the Gospel, and gained some familiarity with some tracts that were deemed useful. One metaphor still stands out, possibly because I still hear it referenced from time-to-time: who sits on the throne of your life? The contrast is between us masquerading as Sovereign over our lives, pushing God to a mere advisory role, versus God reigning as Sovereign (though I’ve never figured out what role we take in that scenario: steward? servant? lackey?). That metaphor has stuck with me all these decades. I take a decidedly passive role in the pattern of my life, and I wonder how much this metaphor has contributed to this state. I wonder if I’ve taken it too far.

# Duty, Responsibility, & Obligation

The pattern of my life has thus far been defined by duty, responsibility, and obligation. Those should be grand words but they’ve come to be weighty and burdensome to me. By way of contrast, I perceive that some people’s patterns are defined by dreams, visions, and goals. When I pause to consider, I never conclude that such people are irresponsible by definition, yet try as I might I’ve been unable to see my life the same way. I am a husband; I made solemn vows that obligate me to my wife. I am a father; I have a God given responsibility to my children: to raise them, to protect them, and to love them. I have been, and will be again, an employee; given the legal paperwork I signed, I have obligations to the company.

That I see my life as a collection of duties, responsibilities, and obligations explains why things like dreams, personal development, leisure, recreation, and relaxation are neglected. I dream of spending my days writing stories. I would love to learn to draw and try my hand at watercolor. I would love to play more games, and even craft some RPG scenarios or campaigns. I don’t pursue these things. I’ll probably never be a writer because I don’t write. I’ll probably never learn to draw because I don’t practice. I’ll likely never figure out how to relax, because I never know when I’ve fulfilled my obligations.

# A New Start

Monday will bring a change to my life. There will be several aspects I will choose to accept and they will shape the boundaries of my life. I will accept a new working schedule. I will accept new responsibilities at work. In doing so the rest of my life, my non-work life, will be impacted. I will still have children to raise, a wife to love, honor, and cherish; somewhere, in a dusty corner of my soul, will still be the dreams of what I thought I could one day become: will I dust those off?
