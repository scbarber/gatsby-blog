I felt fine when I went to bed last night. I didn’t sleep great, but that had more to do with poor ventilation than anything else. I felt okay when I got up. I made coffee. I mixed up some pancakes. By the time the first pancake hit the table, I knew I was done.

Maybe I ate something yesterday that didn’t agree with me. Maybe (probably) the chronic stress has weakened my system. I returned to bed, napped for a few hours, and spent the rest of my day resting and watching an entertaining tour of Australia’s islands as presented by Martin Clunes (which was quite enjoyable). I did whip up some Malt-o-meal muffins for my dinner and am hoping I’ll recover quickly, though I doubt I will recover in time for Father’s Day.
