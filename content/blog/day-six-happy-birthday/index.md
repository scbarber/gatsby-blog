description: "I needed an evening off to rest. I also needed a full night’s sleep, but if the dark circles under my eyes are any indication, the sleep I got wasn’t enough. Nonetheless yesterday’s oppressive overtones have mostly faded. I’m still unemployed, and I’m still endlessly waiting for progress on any of my applications. Today shouldn’t be about me, though; today my eldest turns eleven."

I needed an evening off to rest. I also needed a full night’s sleep, but if the dark circles under my eyes are any indication, the sleep I got wasn’t enough. Nonetheless yesterday’s oppressive overtones have mostly faded. I’m still unemployed, and I’m still endlessly waiting for progress on any of my applications. Today shouldn’t be about me, though; today my eldest turns eleven.

## A Broken Birthday Custom
For several years it has been my custom to spend a day of PTO on the birthday of my immediate family. Last year, a local theme park had a homeschool day, so we all went and had something of a magical time. This year I spent the day at my desk accumulating billable hours on my only contract job (which I understand to have a deadline of tomorrow). I wonder if years from now I will look back on this day and regret my decision to work. I wonder if there will be a way for me to make it up once my employment status is reversed.

## Happiness
It’s hard not to think of happiness on a birthday. Once the customary “Happy Birthday” song is sung, the idea of happiness is in the air. I don’t know what happiness is. I cannot define it, nor can I describe it. I’ve spent a fair portion of my life so far trying to figure this out. So many people around me talk about happiness, being happy, and acting happy; our Declaration of Independence includes the phrase: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

## Unhappiness
Denmark has earned the distinction of being the happiest country on the planet several times. Meik Wiking (the CEO of [The Happiness Research Institute](https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com)) noted that another way to look at it is that Denmark is the least unhappy country (the gist is, they have removed the greatest sources of unhappiness by providing things like a free university education and retirement to all citizens). This perspective appeals to me, not because I’ve been accused of being a pessimist (invariably, the accusation is couched in condemnation, making it clear that pessimism is a problem; I don’t _choose_ to be a pessimist, I just am; being rejected for something I am rather than choose to be is isolating), but because I find it easier to measure unhappiness than happiness.

Perhaps my baseline for happiness is too high (but I’d argue that happiness is subjective, which means I am allowed to set that threshold anywhere I like) because I cannot think of any time I’ve truly been happy. However, I can identify times where I was less unhappy than other times. Last year I would have struggled to tell you I was happy because I could easily identify impediments to my happiness. One year later and I can tell you I was less unhappy then compared to now.

In Kenneth Branagh’s “Murder on the Orient Express” there is a scene early in the film in which Poirot is asked how he was able to solve a mystery with such a tiny clue. He replied, “I can only see the world as it should be. And when it is not, the imperfection stands out like the nose in the middle of the face. It makes most of life unbearable.” That is the closest statement I have come across that describes life for me. I am a perfectionist, but not by choice. I can only “see” how things should be, how people should treat each other, how a piece of art should be arranged, how code should execute. But the world I inhabit is imperfect, and those imperfections, I suspect, prevent me from ever claiming to be happy. But, I _can_ say when I’m less unhappy than other times.

## Celebration
Today is a birthday, and it should be celebrated, for the child of mine who is now eleven is precious to me. Presents were opened this morning. A trip to make art followed by a visit to the Humane Society to enjoy some kittens was had. I had to miss out on both of those, but not dinner. In honor of the birthday I’ve set aside the moratorium on dining out and we’ll enjoy a meal at my eldest’s favorite buffet.
