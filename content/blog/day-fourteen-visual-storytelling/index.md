The last couple of days I’ve been able to fall asleep at roughly the usual time, but I’ve been sleeping more than two hours longer. I feel better for it, and I lament that my life sometimes ends up where I lose sleep. Ironically, I am _not_ losing sleep over not having a job; I feel like I should be, but I’m not.

## Comics & Manga
I spent most of my day reading manga, specifically, Battle Angel Alita. I haven’t let myself do that for a number of years. In High School, comic books were a staple. I formed some relationships over comics, one with an owner of a store that sold comics. I grew up loving animation, especially Japanese animation. When I was a kid, Summer meant the return of shows like Speed Racer, Battleship Yamamotto, and Robotech (which I grew up to learn was Japanese in animation, but American in story). I watched those shows, and any like them, as much as I could.

I’ve come to learn that my brain is rather peculiar because I cannot form images in my mind. When I read, there are no pictures. The few times I dream, they are visual impressions at best. I’ve begun to wonder if my attraction to comics, graphic novels, manga, and animation are because I cannot, and do not, form images in my head. I love to read; I’m usually in the middle of a novel. When I finish a novel I’ll allow myself less than twenty-four hours before starting a new one. All this, and I cannot form images in my head, which has caused more than a few people to wonder what I get out of reading (I in turn wonder what _they_ get out of reading).

Today, I returned to a manga I started reading over twenty years ago. Now, I have most of the series in digital format, and I decided it was time to dive into that world once again. It was a joy to look at and to read. Part of what pushed me to do this was some advice to write about what I love, which caused me to think on what I love. I’m not sure I will write a story about comics, but it was important to me to reconnect to an older part of myself that takes joy in the simple pleasure of reading and looking at pictures.

## Still Unemployed
The interview I had on Tuesday has yet to produce anything. I had hoped to hear something by now. Now I have to wait for Monday, and if I still hear nothing I’ll assume the worst and flood the Internet with a fresh batch of applications. We won’t have the weekend we were hoping to have. We didn’t get to have the celebratory evening we’ve been waiting six weeks to have. Someday.
