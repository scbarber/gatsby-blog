I slept until almost 10am. It’s a Thursday and I deliciously overslept, and I don’t care. There were no consequences either. I slept, I woke up, I lingered in bed, affording myself time to fully awaken, then I started my day. I didn’t need to care about other people; I only needed to care about me, and that’s what I’ve done today.

I missed the WWDC Keynote, but I have the app. After breakfast I enjoyed my tea while watching those parts I cared about. I could have lived without seeing it. My life didn’t change because I did, but I was able to check something off a mental list, and that process is important. I was relieved of a burden, even though it was slight. Leaving it unchecked, and having to abandon it altogether, was something I didn’t want to do, I used to enjoy the Keynotes, and loved watching them live. It was a time to see what one company was doing and promising. It’s a time to get a glimpse at a possible future, and I value that. I may not subscribe to all their services, and I may not own all their devices, but I like to see what is becoming possible.

## Writing
I happened to scroll through my digital journal last night and came across an entry I made in response to a YouTube video. The video is titled ["An Evening with Ray Bradbury"](https://youtu.be/_W-r7ABrMYU) and it was recorded in 2001. I recalled watching this video five years ago, but I thought it was time to rewatch it; last night I promised myself that I would take some time to do so. I’m glad I did; the video is well worth watching and rewatching.

This year I’ve given myself the challenge of writing one short story a week, because this was the same challenge Ray Bradbury gave in that video. He defied us to write 52 bad stories, claiming it cannot be done. His attitude and his words encouraged me five years ago, and did so again today. I want to write. I want to pick up my pen, grab a notebook, and make ink marks on the paper. I want to tell stories. I want to be known and loved for who I am and for what I do.

## Creative Bank Account
I don’t know when I first encountered the metaphor of a creative bank account, but I keep running into it time and again, and I think it works rather well. Mine has been empty for far too long; my creative checks have been bouncing. Today turned out to be a day in which I have been making deposits into that account. Watching some videos of a writer talk about writing and encouraging an audience to write helps. What also helps is that I’m not making any withdraws today.

I’ve known for some time that my work, or at least the way I work, as a software engineer overlaps with creative writing: they both draw from the same account (I usually think of it as a well at this point, but I’m told mixing metaphors is bad). I’ve yet to figure out why this is, because the work itself doesn’t seem to share much in common. But I know that at the end of a long day writing code I can be so depleted that I cannot write a page of fiction. Likewise, those days when I can write fiction, are days in which I did light, or no, programming.

## Writing vs. Programming
I don’t want those two part so my life to continue to be at odds with each other. One pays the bills, and that’s not only important, but it’s both necessary, and an obligation. The other soothes my soul in a way nothing else can, but it has always played second fiddle (yet another metaphor; I actually played second fiddle once, not to mention first chair second violins). I want to live and work in a world in which I can both pay my bills by writing software, and soothe my soul by writing fiction. So far that world hasn’t been possible, but that doens’t mean I’m going to give up trying to create, or foster, that world.

I don’t know that I will ever be a “successful” writer, partly because I don’t even know what that means. I think what I want is to be able to tell my story, the story of me, to be able to connect with and relate to other people. I’ve wanted this since my childhood, and back then I tried to use stories to do that. Invariably I had people try to edit me out of the story, which only made things worse. Now I know that Asperger’s Syndrome is in play, and I’m merely trying to do what all neurotypicals do naturally and easily. I’m trying to connect, I’m trying to be known, I’m trying to be loved. I cannot do that face-to-face because I fundamentally and categorically reject the very notion of “body language.” I know it is a thing the majority of human beings claim exists, and use, and I do much to accommodate that, but I’ll probably go to my grave believing in a collective insanity. I wish I could accept and use body language; I wish tones of voice could mean something to me; I wish I could understand the meaning in a glance, or a facial expression, or a wardrobe. I cannot, and even with years of practice I’ll still never be good at a it. So, I write. All I have are words. Everyone else has paralingual tools, I do not. Some day, I hope I’ll write a story and someone will read it, and they will know something of me, and they will love me for it. Until then, I’ll keep writing code and computers will keep...loving me?
