I didn’t want to wake up today. I’ve been running on a stress-induced sleep deficit for several months now. I no longer have a boss who will fire me for not showing up to work on time, so I wanted to spend more time in bed; I wanted to sleep a little longer, rest a bit more, and hope to feel more alert and functional today. Instead, I felt guilty and harried. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was late.

I have a week of 1099 contract work. Taxes aside, this will pay better than my full-time job. But taxes are never aside; they must always be paid; the tax-man cometh. So I had work to do today, and I didn’t much want to. I have to track my time for this week; I will only get paid for the billable time I spend. I’ve had the hardest time with that business model because it drives me to spend more time than I ought. I push myself past the point of mental exhaustion to keep billing out time, and that’s not healthy.

## To Apply or Not To Apply
I’d much rather contemplate being, or not being, than having to decide to keep sending out fresh applications. I’m well over a month into this process, and I haven’t had a single job offer. I have a couple of companies that have moved beyond the first interview, and one I still hope to hear from (still nothing; is that good or bad?). Honestly, the idea of having to keep submitting applications just to wait another month for more of the same is discouraging. Nevertheless, I applied to two more companies today, bringing my total to 43. I also had to turn down a second interview today because the compensation package fell short of our current needs.

I was ready for a marathon, but I didn’t accurately estimate how much of a marathon this would be. I don’t know if I have another day, another week, or another month, or more, of unemployment left. Today I had to write code whilst distracted about my employment state, and rushing to open every single email that came, only to find none of them were job related. I’m not convinced I did my best work today, and when done I still had to put forth effort into finding a job. I managed about twenty minutes to watch [Dude Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/user/corycotton) and another YouTube video with my kids, then it was time for dinner. I used to need a vacation, now I need a job, and then a vacation.
