This morning I signed the offer letter. Thus begins the countdown to my new job! I’m not technically employed yet, but I’m not really unemployed either. I’m in this brief but odd state between the two, a "Between Time" if you will. A strange thing has occurred, I resumed some chores I didn't consciously realize I had stopped doing.

## Survival Mode
Back when I was a pastoral intern, I recall my pastor mentioning the term "survival mode". I don't recall if we had any conversations about what that meant, signified, or implied. It wasn't much of a stretch to realize there are other modes of living, each with their own focus. I can't name them, but I know they must exist. I've been told there is more to life than surviving, thus there must be more modes than Survival. I suspect there is a mode in which a person thrives, though I struggle to describe what that looks like. There's likely a maintenance mode, which I think would be a step above survival; maybe they are synonymous, but I doubt they are identical.

I'm not conscious of what mode I'm currently operating in. It wasn't until I signed my offer letter that I realized I was in Survival Mode. I was doing all I could to mitigate loss. Rather than embracing new opportunities, I was protecting what I could, and sacrificing what I could not. Obviously things like dining out, or take-out, were abandoned as we rationed our money, but that was not all I was rationing.

## Mental/Emotional Rationing
Chores are not something I look forward to. They must be done, and several have built-in motivators, but not all need to retain their old schedule. Today, I realized I had been putting off the doing of some chores. The consequences of doing so were low; we were hardly inconvenienced. Since there wasn't a pressing need, I didn't make myself do it, and I didn't notice I made this decision either. I wasn't intentionally rebelling against the chores, I just couldn't muster the wherewithal to do them.

There is something about chores that drains me. I might be able to listen to an audiobook while doing some chores, and that can redeem some of them. I'm realizing that the mere decision to do a chore will take something out of me; even if I can enjoy a book through it, getting a return on the chore, I have to muster _something_ in order to start. I don't always have that currency and sometimes I don't have the credit to start.

What amazes me is how a simple act of signing an offer letter, signifying that I will have an income, was enough. Out of nowhere I decided to tackle my backlog of chores, and I did so of my own initiative, and with some lightness in my heart. I can only conclude that I've shifted out of one mode into a new one and that shift has reallocated some resources.

## A New Mode
I don't know what mode I'm in now, but I know I feel good about my future. I may not have signed all the necessary paperwork, but that feels more of a formality. Come Monday I'll be employed again, with a steady income and that makes quite a difference in my mode of living.
