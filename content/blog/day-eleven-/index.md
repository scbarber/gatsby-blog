She also recommended I knock off early and rest prior to my interview (I forgot to do that; don’t tell her, she might fire me). I used to get up between 7am and 7:30am; the clock was well past 8:20am when I first opened my eyes. I needed that."

Yesterday’s headache persisted through bedtime. I took the wife’s advice and ignored any internal imperative to wake up at a given time. Her point: I’m self-employed; I’m not going to fire myself for showing up late. She also recommended I knock off early and rest prior to my interview (I forgot to do that; don’t tell her, she might fire me). I used to get up between 7am and 7:30am; the clock was well past 8:20am when I first opened my eyes. I needed that.

I’m nearly wrapped up with my contract work. I’m not yet at the 40 billable hours, but I’ve taken a few more days than I originally anticipated. I’m down to just the detail work of testing and correcting edge cases. It was a more relaxed morning, maybe because I got some good sleep. My headache is gone and I can think with clarity, which is what I expect of myself. As such, I have a clear mental path to wrap up the work, and that always makes me feel better.

Today’s interview was a paired programming task. It was the least stressful technical test/challenge/activity I’ve ever had to do. They were trying a new approach, and I got to be a guinea pig, which I didn’t mind. What I liked about the task was that it simulated a real work relationship. I got to talk over pros and cons of an approach and we could decide which trade-offs to accept together. It wasn’t a test with a best/right answer so much as it was an opportunity to see how we can work together to get something done. Dare I say it, I might have even enjoyed myself a little.

## Am I Really a Software Engineer?

All throughout this period of looking for work I’ve wondered if I’m really a software engineer, or if I’m someone who can do software engineering. I’ve been asking myself that question for several years now, and I suspect I’ll not stop asking it until I stop doing what a software engineer does. But having 1% of my applications result in an interview has had me wondering if I’m at a fork in the road and I should pursue a different career.

Ever since high school, I’ve wanted to be an author. I’ve wanted to write novels and tell stories. I didn’t, and haven’t, because I was told that most writers cannot support a family, and I took that to heart and gave up before I really got started. I didn’t just give it up as a vocation, but I also walked away from it as a hobby pursuit. I shouldn’t have.

There was a time when I was in a pulpit, pastoring a small congregation. It was terrifying but rewarding. It was perhaps the only time in my life that I didn’t question whether or not what I was doing mattered, or had significance. I was certain that it did, which is why it was terrifying. But I missed being creative. I missed making new things and playing with new frontiers, so I refocused my efforts on software engineering.

Today, I spent an hour working on a problem, writing code that’ll never be used, and doing so without compensation, and I kind of enjoyed it. I’ll spend days and weeks pondering what that means, but for now I’m concluding that there is still a place for me in software engineering. I can do the work and sometimes enjoy myself. That counts for something. Maybe I’ll still get to be an author. Maybe that’ll be what I retire _to_.
