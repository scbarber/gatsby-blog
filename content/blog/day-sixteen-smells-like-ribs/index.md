title: "Day Sixteen: Smells Like Ribs"
description: "It’s Father’s Day. Mine is away grading AP Stat’s exams. I slept until nearly 11am; my wife thinks I’m making up for four years of burnout. I think my body is fighting off something that made me ill yesterday, and is contending with chronic stress. Either way, I did quite a lot of sleeping. After a light breakfast I did some reading, then took a nap. I’ve half a mind to become concerned with all the sleeping I’ve been doing."

It’s Father’s Day. Mine is away grading AP Stat’s exams. I slept until nearly 11am; my wife thinks I’m making up for four years of burnout. I think my body is fighting off something that made me ill yesterday, and is contending with chronic stress. Either way, I did quite a lot of sleeping. After a light breakfast I did some reading, then took a nap. I’ve half a mind to become concerned with all the sleeping I’ve been doing.

Today was more resting because I’m eager to resume eating normal food. To that end, my wife bought some ribs for dinner. Time will tell if I made a poor decision, but we all gathered around the table in the basement, rotated the TV to face said table, and ate ribs while I introduced my children to TRON.

I heard that a coworker who was laid off at the same time as me, starts a new job tomorrow. I’m happy for him. I know what a relief it must be to know there is a paycheck coming. I also know the stress of starting a new position with a new team. I wish him all the best, and hope that it’ll be my turn soon enough. Maybe tomorrow I’ll get an offer.
