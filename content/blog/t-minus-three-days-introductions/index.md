I will soon be faced with a group of people who are, at present, strangers to me. Considering I hope to remain at this company for several years, I have the hope and expectation that they will not remain strangers, but that we’ll grow to become familiar to one another. The road to familiarity starts with introductions and get-to-know-you questions, and these have always been problematic for me.

## Introduce Yourself
In all my years I've never known what to say when I'm told to introduce myself. "Hi, I'm Seth," isn't enough. "I'm a man," should be obvious given my broad shoulders and hard-to-miss beard, and not useful even it wasn't obvious. Despite having listened to several answers over the years, I still have no idea what people want to know about me. "Tell us about yourself" is vague, and while there's technically no wrong answer, there are answers that are less useful than others. Do they want to know that I am married, or that I have children? Would they care about the gender of my children? Is it relevant, or interesting, to talk about pets?

I've spent more time than I care to calculate pondering how best to respond when faced with this, because I can't off-the-cuff give a good reply. In short, having to introduce myself, without direction or guidance, generates stress and some measure of anxiety. I forever live with the admonition to make a good first impression. I don't want to come across as a weirdo; eccentric would be nice, as then people wouldn't assume I'm typical; I can handle "quirky" as that connotes a degree of fondness and harmlessness. In truth, I'm atypical and while I know and embrace that, I'm not sure how people will respond to that knowledge.

## Fun
One of the questions that gets asked in that get-to-know-you phase is, “What do you do for fun?” It's a good question and the answers people give are beautifully enlightening, unless I'm the one answering it. When I contemplate that question the first thing I ask is, "What is fun?" followed by, "Do I have fun?" then, "When was the last time I had fun?" I turn a simple get-to-know-you question into a philosophical discourse.

I honestly don't have a good handle on fun. It's been a long time since I've had that subjective feeling I associate with fun. I have list of things I used to do and called fun. I used to watch anime, read comic books, graphic novels, and manga. I used to play video games. I used to play board games (I still think that I do, but I keep records of when and what I play, and I know I don't really play like I used to). I read, and sometimes write fiction. I cannot tell you why these activities stopped being fun. Reading is something I still do, and I could say I read for fun, but it's more accurate to say I read to cope with life.

These days, when I'm asked about what activities I do for fun, I assume they want to know about what I do for recreation, or what hobbies I have. To that end, I include my board game library, my fountain pen collection, and stories. It's less accurate than a discourse on fun, which I would enjoy (maybe I have fun pondering fun), but I hope it serves to answer the question being asked.

## Monday
If it's not already clear I'm under some stress about Monday. Starting a new job is hard because getting to know people is hard for me. First impressions take time to overcome, so I feel pressure to get it right. Regardless of my talents or skills at my profession, if I cannot get along with my coworkers, I won't keep my job. So, I'm gearing up to meet some strangers and hopefully befriend them.
