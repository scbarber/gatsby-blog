I am now officially unemployed. Again. This is the second time I've been forcibly unemployed. I've been laid off for the third (possibly fourth) time in my life. So here I am, a software engineer with over twenty years of experience, without a job. I'm uncomfortable, nervous, anxious, and confused.

## Unemployment History
The first time I found myself unemployed is a painful and traumatic memory I cannot forget, no matter how hard I've tried. My wife and I had celebrated our second Valentine's Day as a married couple; we were first-time home buyers with less than four months in our house. When I got up that morning I had a full-time job. When I arrived home unexpectedly, I was unemployed without notice. Worse, I had been escorted from the small bungalow which served as the offices for the company. My co-workers, both of whom were my personal friends, were confused. I was told that my employers had been floating my position the entire time. I was hired because they had a client with particular technical needs, and when that client went out of business I lost my job.

All this coincided with the dot-com crash. I spent four hours a day, five days week, for six months, sending out applications and resumes, calling recruiters, and praying for an interview. I got two interviews. The first rejected me, and the second hired me on a part-time basis. A few days a week I'd have a two-hour round-trip commute to work. Eventually the job went full-time, and I worked there for a few years, but the commute wore me down.

The day I tendered my resignation from that job my boss was relieved: he came into work with a heavy heart for he was going to give me notice that I was going to be laid off. I did not see this coming, though looking back it isn't terribly surprising.

Some years later, I have a two children, five and three, and my boss at the time confided that the company didn't have enough money to cover the next month's payroll.  I didn't need to be told what to do: I immediately began looking for work. We payroll, and after a series of interviews I got a job offer. I was excited to get that email because the interview process went well, and I wanted to work for the company. At the time we were barely making ends meet, struggling each month to find just a little left over to splurge on a pizza or two. A part of my hopes with looking for a new job was to find one that paid significantly better. The offer I received was for less than I was making, so with a great sense of defeat I declined and readied myself to resume the interview circuit. That was when my boss told me he was going to lay me off in three weeks.

I was confused. At the time I had a lofty title containing the words "Director" and "Technology" and while I didn't think that would keep me safe from downsizing, I didn't think I would be the first to go. I had long suspected I was one of the highest paid employees of the company, so maybe it was a pure numbers game. I was also one of two remote employees, and there had always been some us vs. them tension that I could not overcome no matter how hard I tried.

I reached out and the job offer I declined was still available, so I accepted it. By the grace of God we made it financially. Now some five years later this job too, has been taken from me. At the beginning of May two of us (which was about half the company) were given notice that we were being laid off. We would be paid through May, and then that's it. It was a financial decision. I was shocked, but not surprised (or was I surprised but not shocked?): I knew the company was in bad shape, but I thought I had another six months.

## Present Reality
I spent all of last month sending out applications and resumes. To date, I've sent out 41. I've received a handful of rejections, fewer interviews, and as yet, no job offers. I had expected a job offer on Friday, or if not an actual offer at least communication on the next step, but nothing came. I have a one week contract to work on a site, and another day's worth of work elsewhere, then the income stops altogether. I have only one more interview lined up, and am now waiting on two companies to indicate if I'm going forward or have been rejected.

## The Lie
I'm in my fourth decade of life and somewhere along the way I began to believe the lie that if you work hard enough, are diligent enough, prove yourself to be trustworthy, honest, conscientious, and in all other ways a good employee, things would go well for you. No one fires a model employee. So, I've strived all my life to be a model employee. Three times, nearly four, I've been laid off. Twice now I've found myself unemployed. I've not been fired, but that's little consolation.

I have people cheering for me, and I wish that could do some good. I have friends who would hire me in a heartbeat (why is that the idiom for instantaneous when there are several things in nature that are faster?) if they could afford to pay me what they think I'm worth; not only do they think I'm a good programmer, they think I'm worth twice what I've been making. The sentiment warms my heart, but hasn't helped. My former boss has been begging me to let him write me a letter of recommendation and to have people contact him as a reference; he didn't want to let me go. My former co-workers are all hoping I land a job with an extravagant paycheck. None of this matters, because none of these people, as well meaning and kind as they are, can affect a change in my circumstance.

If I am to listen to the people around me, I'm an excellent employee. All my performance reviews have been stellar. I still recall when my CTO told me that new hires took, on average, six months before they were effective, but that I was already effective within three. There were times when my CEO praised my work ethic, something I thought still needed improving. By all accounts I've been an excellent employee, but that's always good enough. Sometimes, even the good employees get let go.

## The Future
I'll admit it: the future scares me. I don't want to watch my savings account dwindle, but just living incurs expenses. I have a mortgage on a home that is as close to a dream home as I had ever hoped to see. I need Internet and electricity to continue looking for work. We don't "need" Netflix, but I do need something at the end of my day to quell the stress and anxiety in my body.

## Today
I had a technical evaluation as a next step today. There were three questions, one on SQL and two using PHP. The SQL used two terms/commands I'd never seen in all my years. I had fifteen minutes to figure out what they meant, and so far as I could tell they are specific to MSSQL. This was odd since the job is for a LAMP stack. According to the results, I failed that question: I got a 77%. For reference, I was a 4.0 student. I graduated with honors. I'm not feeling good about my chances with that job.

I had to turn down an interview offer that came to me, because the job refused remote workers. There is a second interview I will have to decline because the outlined compensation package is not adequate.

The wife is growing into a professional photographer, and had a wedding to shoot today. So much of the day was spent playing Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion on my PS3 (yep, I still don't have a PS4, and obviously cannot afford one) while my kiddos watched.

It's day one of unemployment, and a month's worth of effort at finding a new job has yet to pay off. I expect nothing will happen any sooner than Monday.
