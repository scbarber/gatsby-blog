title: "Day Twelve: Cold and Exhausted"

So, we keep the windows closed and run the air conditioner in the late afternoons and at night. I work in the basement. This morning it was 64ºF in the basement, but 70ºF in the rest of the house. I couldn’t bring myself to turn on the heat. So, I was cold all morning."

It’s been warming up where I live. Grass has also been pollenating, and that’s my main allergen. So, we keep the windows closed and run the air conditioner in the late afternoons and at night. I work in the basement. This morning it was 64ºF in the basement, but 70ºF in the rest of the house. I couldn’t bring myself to turn on the heat. So, I was cold all morning.

The ductwork for the central air runs throughout the basement, and some of the joints leak air. Also, hot air rises, meaning cold air pools at the bottom; therefore, it is only natural that the basement will be colder than the rest of the house. Also, the basement is below grade (underground) and that has some thermodynamic impact. Despite me keeping the vents in the basement closed it was largely uninhabitable today.

## Wall of Exhaustion
I wrapped up my contract work before lunch, and within an hour a heavy exhaustion settled in and sapped all my mental acuity. I’ve had similar reactions upon completing stressful obligations. It’s good to get some of that weight off my shoulders; no one is waiting for me to get work done any more; I have fulfilled all my outstanding professional obligations; I can finally relax…until I recall I’m unemployed.

I tried to nap, but I was not physically tired, just emotionally and mentally wiped out. Before dinner the exhaustion began playing with my moods, as I’m learning it does, and I had to turn my attention to distractions. That found me trolling YouTube for interesting topics, watching TED talks, and generally keeping myself occupied with knowledge acquisition.

I hope to sleep in now that I have no reason to get up in the morning. I hope to rest and recharge. Maybe I’ll finish the book I’m reading. Maybe I’ll watch some documentaries on my some-day list. Maybe I’ll play a board game, or do some drawing, or go swimming. I’m going to try to treat the rest of the week like a vacation (but without the anxiety of a typical vacation). I’ll probably also check my email to see if there’s a job offer.
