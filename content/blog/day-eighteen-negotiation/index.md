There’s not much I’m going to say about the day other than I’m negotiating a job offer. It’s been a tense day as I had to weigh and judge how I would reply, and then to wait. So far, I’ve heard nothing, which I hope is not a sign that I upset things. I did distract myself with a few hours of Oblivion, in which I was finally able to buy a manor in a seaside village, which turned out to be haunted; it couldn’t have been more perfect for me.

I’m trying not to hold my breath, though blue is my favourite colour. It goes well with the silver in my beard.
