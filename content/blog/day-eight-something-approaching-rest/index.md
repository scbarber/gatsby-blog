description: "I rebelled against my inner-self today. I made overnight waffles for our Saturday breakfast. I had a conversation with my wife. I read my Bible and talked with God in a quiet moment of solitude. I worked on the tooling behind this blog. I did some reading. Then I spent the rest of the day playing Oblivion while the family watched. I didn’t allow myself to get caught up in what I thought I <i>ought</i> to do. I did what I promised myself I would do."

I rebelled against my inner-self today. I made overnight waffles for our Saturday breakfast. I had a conversation with my wife. I read my Bible and talked with God in a quiet moment of solitude. I worked on the tooling behind this blog. I did some reading. Then I spent the rest of the day playing Oblivion while the family watched. I didn’t allow myself to get caught up in what I thought I _ought_ to do. I did what I promised myself I would do.

I wouldn’t say I relaxed today, but I came closer than I have in recent memory. Somehow I was able to shove aside the employment-conscious part of me, which allowed me to just be today. I didn’t get lost in playing with code; I didn’t get lost in the story I read; I didn’t get lost playing the video game. But still, I was able to put off some of pressure that usually travels with me. My body still bears the marks of prolonged and chronic stress, so I still have some “work” to do if I am to be healthy.

Things are as stable as they can be, so today was for resting and playing. Monday will come soon enough, and with it, a return to duty and responsibility.
