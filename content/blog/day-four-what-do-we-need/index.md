Growing up in the public school system, they were teaching, and pushing us to adopt, [Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). I still remember feeling uncomfortable with the pyramid (triangle, really, but I _still_ think of it as a pyramid) doubting that any one man could accurately sum up the needs of all people for all time. I had no trouble accepting that people need air to breath, food to eat, water to drink, and for the sake of sun burns and societal cooperation, we need clothing. The rest of it was dubious, especially the idea of esteem and "self-actualization" which no one was ever able to explain to me (if you cannot satisfactorily explain a thing to me, I cannot, in good conscience, accept it).

## Need vs. Want

I've struggled all my life with the word "need". I've tried to find that line between "need" and "want" and I'm not sure I've ever succeeded. Now that I'm unemployed there are several areas of my life, of our life, that I now look at and wonder, "Do we _need_ this, or do we _want_ this? Can we live without this? What are the ramifications for going without this?” I find myself asking if we need things like Netflix; there’s no doubt that we all want it, and enjoy it, but there’s that question of need. I’d estimate there a billions of people successfully living without Netflix.

I’m slowly starting to think of requirements rather than needs: the requirements for _x_ are _y_ and _z_. The requirements for biological life are food and water. One of the requirements for social acceptance is clothing. Since I am a remote software engineer, I require both electricity and Internet. Since unemployment is stressful relaxation seems in order. One of the ways I relax is watching TV, so Netflix (or one of its competitors) fulfills a requirement of relaxation.

Now all I need to do is figure out if relaxation is a need or a want. The same goes for enjoyment, happiness, peace, security, and a whole host of abstracts. I’ve read, and listened to, several books touching on various areas of psychology, and I’ve been struck with how many of these abstracts are emphatically categorized as needs. I’m sure most people would shake their heads at me in wonder that I struggle to accept happiness or security as a need.

I don’t feel entitled to such things. I don’t feel I have a right to demand of anyone that I should have them. That’s what a _need_ is to me; it is non-negotiable; without the fulfillment of a need I will cease to function and possibly die. I may not flourish without happiness, peace, or security, but I can function. Admittedly, I’m splitting hairs, but this is how my brain works; this is what I have to live with. I know we can live without, and I know we’d all rather not, and I have no qualms about requesting the fulfillments of my wants, but I have a hard time being persistent, let alone demanding, for a want.

## Birthday Gifts

My eldest’s eleventh birthday is in two days. What kind of a father would I be if there were no birthday gifts? What kind of financial steward would I be if I were lavash in bestowing gifts in the absence of income? Here is where the proverbial rubber meets the road, and where faith in a benevolent God intersects. One of the ways of expressing love is give a gift. Gifts mean something to my eldest, and I think more harm would be done by withholding a gift than spending a little money to show my love and affection.

It’s hard for me to ask others to go without, but easy to ask it of myself. Consequently, there will be birthday gifts, but Father’s Day will likely be little more than some hot meat and a cold beverage, and if I’m lucky I’ll get to play a board game with my family.

## Tomorrow: Interviews

Tomorrow holds some promise: I have two interviews. The first interview of the day crosses several time zones, and I’m uncomfortable for it. There may be a language barrier; there certainly will be a cultural one. I don’t know if this company employs US citizens. This will be a first for me, and thankfully it’s a shorter half-hour interview (I assume it’s a screening). The second interview of the day is a third-round interview. I’m hoping that will produce a job offer and this journey of mine will be short.

My wife interviewed for a photography job today. She is hoping I’ll get an offer before she does. She’s on the fence about the position. She loves photography, and is good at it, but the compensation is exploitative to the point of being offensive. It would be some income for us, and experience for her, but there is much hesitation (and that usually means something).
