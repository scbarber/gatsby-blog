title: "Day Nineteen:  Offer Accepted"
description: "After an evening of radio silence I awoke and found an email requesting an afternoon meeting. That’s not much to go on; there are no lines to read between (an expression that has always struck me as frightening: there’s only whitespace between lines; if you can read whitespace....). I didn’t know if I was heading into a good meeting, a tense meeting, or an outright bad one. I’m not adept when it comes to negotiating; I can’t “read” people; all people are opaque to me."

After an evening of radio silence I awoke and found an email requesting an afternoon meeting. That’s not much to go on; there are no lines to read between (an expression that has always struck me as frightening: there’s only whitespace between lines; if you can read whitespace....). I didn’t know if I was heading into a good meeting, a tense meeting, or an outright bad one. I’m not adept when it comes to negotiating; I can’t “read” people; all people are opaque to me.

I distracted myself with chores all morning. The stress of the meeting was immense, easily meeting, if not exceeding, that of any of my interviews over the previous weeks. Finally, the time came. I sat at my computer, I loaded up the video conference app, and I waited, heart hammering in my chest.

I had not offended. In fact, I don’t think I created any problem. I got a bit more information about the company and was presented with two options. Both of the options were acceptable, but one really made me smile. We are a single-income family, and my wife really is my partner in life; she’s my equal in many ways (and better than me in some important facets). It didn’t take her long to agree with me on which option to accept.

We celebrated with Chinese food, something we haven’t had for nearly two months, and something we really enjoy. It’s taken longer than I anticipated to get to this point, but I believe I’ve found a company I can grow with while I put my talents to use growing their product(s).
