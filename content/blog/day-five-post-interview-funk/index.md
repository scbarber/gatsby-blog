I had two interviews today; one an initial screening, the other a third-round interview. Now I am exhausted, drained, and feeling rather low. In fact, I’m weathering a storm of insignificance and inadequacy. Losing my job was a hard blow, but even harder is enduring the scrutiny of the interview process.

## Judement
I hate interviews. I sincerely wish to avoid them. Interviews hit me the same way school social dynamics did. It’s time to measure me, to see if I will fit with the company culture, to see if I meet their expectations, and even to assign a monetary value to me. At the end of a successful interview process is the inevitable summing up of my worth. There’s nothing quite so humbling as to see a number and know that’s your value to the company; there is your worth in their eyes. But, I must endure interviews if I am to have a job, so I must also endure the questions, the inscrutable looks, and ultimately, the judgement.

## Impact
Human interaction of any kind comes at a cost for me. Social engagements are invariably draining; the more people involved, the quicker I’m drained. Likewise, the more intense the exchange, the more drained I get. Interviews are an interesting phenomena because they are a formalized process of rejection. Resumes and applications are screened to “weed out” (reject) applicants that don’t qualify. Interviews are then designed to further narrow the pool of applicants until the candidate for the position is found and offered a job.

Rejection is especially hard for me. When I think of my school days I think of rejection. I think of all the ways I didn’t fit in (I was too different), and all the ways people declined to be my friend. That was the hardest time of my life, and it was marked by rejection. Having to submit myself to a process that will result in further rejection pushes all the wrong buttons.

## Evaluating an Interview
Invariably I’m asked, “How’d it go?” when I conclude an interview. I hate that question because the answer reveals one of my flaws. I don’t know how my interviews go. I cannot read people. They contort their faces, change their pitch, or tone, maybe they pause, maybe they hem and haw, and I have no idea what any of that means. Two years ago I found out that I have Asperger’s Syndrome; because of my neurology I have no natural ability to understand human conversational metadata.

I can recognize when there’s a physical state change, but I don’t know what it means. I’ve lived long enough and had enough coaching and conditioning to have a decent database of gross meanings. This helps with a lot of day-to-day face-to-face interactions, which I limit as much as possible, but when it comes to evaluating an interview I’m usually left with less than a clue.

So I had two interviews today and I think the people that interacted with me didn’t dislike me. There were smiles and even some relaxed postures. They might have liked me as a person, but that doesn’t mean I gave them answers they wanted to hear. I strive to be honest and truthful all the time, and I’ve enough scars to know that sometimes that doesn’t pay in the short-term. I had two interviews, I withstood a battery of questions, and now I feel a bit dejected. I have limitations, I ran up against them today, and I feel lousy for it. This is why tomorrow is a blessing, for tomorrow is a new day and I can put this one behind me.
