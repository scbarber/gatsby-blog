Of the approximate four dozen applications I’ve submitted, one company has consistently marched forward, and tomorrow I will have my fourth interview with this company. I got the news early in the morning, and promptly agreed, rather hoping to get it done and over with, because interviews take a lot out of me. It wasn’t until a little after lunch that I realized the anticipatory stress of yet another interview had given me a headache, and the day was not yet over.

My body gave out on me in the mid-afternoon. I hit a metaphorical wall and had to rest. I couldn’t quite slip into a nap, partly because we had somewhere to be in the early evening, so I rested as best I could, and found that my ability to function was compromised.

There may be a time in the future in which I understand what happened to me today. If so, I hope I learn from this and can successfully avoid a repeat performance. From here, all I can conclude is that interviews stress me out, but having to continue to interview time and again with the same company wears on me even more. There is a greater pressure on tomorrow because I’m busy wondering what it is they don’t know about me yet that’s preventing them from deciding to offer me a job or to reject me and move on. I’m also morbidly curious if there’s a fifth interview. Maybe I should request one.
