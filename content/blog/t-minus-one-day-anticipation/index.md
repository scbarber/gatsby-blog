title: "T-Minus One Day: Anticipation"
description: "Tomorrow morning I start my new job; I have some anxiety with that. It wasn’t too long ago that I was an established presence in a company. I knew the people I worked with, they knew me, I knew what was expected of me, and most of all, I knew I could meet that expectation day after day. Tomorrow, I know none of that. Tomorrow, everything is uncertain, and Uncertainty is a bedfellow of Anxiety."

Tomorrow morning I start my new job; I have some anxiety with that. It wasn’t too long ago that I was an established presence in a company. I knew the people I worked with, they knew me, I knew what was expected of me, and most of all, I knew I could meet that expectation day after day. Tomorrow, I know none of that. Tomorrow, everything is uncertain, and Uncertainty is a bedfellow of Anxiety.

## Uncertainty
I read somewhere that many of us Aspergians[^1] struggle to handle uncertainty. I won’t go so far as to say that knowledge brings me comfort, but I feel less bad for myself knowing it’s not unique to me. Since there are others out there like me, in this regard, I might find some grace out in the world, if not some tips on how to cope. I like predictability; I like certainty; I love precision. These things bring a sense of comfort and safety to me.

I also need to prepare in order to interact with human beings. When I engage with a human being I know, I’m able to “keep up” with their responses. I have enough data to process their communication in real time, which means I can more quickly identify their tone, gestures, and expressions. In a way, I match what I’m currently experiencing with something I’ve experienced before, and that helps me to know how best to respond (and then I analyze their reaction to my response to see how accurate I was). My human interactions are governed by a series of algorithms.[^2] When I interact with a stranger I have only generic experiences to match, and I’ve come to learn those are error-prone.

## Learning Curve
There’s a learning curve with any new job. I won’t need to learn a new programming language to do mine, but I expect I’ll have to learn some new code habits. I’ve never seen their codebase before, and I’ll have to learn, and become familiar, with it. I’ll have to learn the company culture. I’ll also have to learn how to interact with each of my new coworkers, and this is a nontrivial task for me. I also have to be careful with how I present myself, so that they don’t “learn” the wrong thing about me; I’ve learned this lesson the hard way, by trial and error, over the decades.

One of the things causing a small measure of anxiety is the question of tackling this learning curve. Will I be able to overcome it in time? How long will it take for me to become minimally productive, and how much longer until I’m operating at full capacity? When will they expect me to reach a satisfactory level of productivity? I’ve had to ask myself this question at each and every new job start. So far, I’ve never had a problem, but neither have I been able to _know_ I was on target.

Time will tell.




[^1]: I’ve never liked the term “Aspie” and there are too many wrong connotations with the various word forms for “autism” for me to use it to describe me.

[^2]: I’ve begun to wonder if I should try my hand at artificial intelligence and/or machine learning. It’s probably not too far off from how I live my life.
