title: "Day Seventeen: A Job Offer"
description: "I’m getting used to sleeping until my body says it has had enough. It’s a relief to allow myself what has become, but should never be, the luxury of Enough Sleep. Shortly after waking up I checked my email and had…a request to meet and ”discuss an employment opportunity.” I agreed on the suggested time of 5pm and spent my day wondering about the difference between an “employment opportunity” and a “job offer.” It’s often that I ponder such differences; it’s a function of my Asperger’s Syndrome (words are supreme over context)."

I’m getting used to sleeping until my body says it has had enough. It’s a relief to allow myself what has become, but should never be, the luxury of Enough Sleep. Shortly after waking up I checked my email and had…a request to meet and ”discuss an employment opportunity.” I agreed on the suggested time of 5pm and spent my day wondering about the difference between an “employment opportunity” and a “job offer.” It’s often that I ponder such differences; it’s a function of my Asperger’s Syndrome (words are supreme over context).

I had an eight hour wait for that meeting. I filled that time with troubleshooting my Drobo 5N, which no longer has any open ports after upgrading the firmware. It’s also out of warranty and it looks like the company won’t support it. There’s an outside chance I’ve lost everything on that array; this would be the second time a Drobo of mine has failed (the last time was five years ago, and I was able to recover all the data).

I also did some reading, some distracted playing of video games, and watched some Dude Perfect with my kiddos. Then the time came and I had a fifth face-to-face.

The “employment opportunity” is a job offer! There’s an increase over what I used to be making, though I would now be responsible for the lion’s share (why lion and not elephant or rhinoceros, or killer shark?) of the health insurance premium for my wife and kids. That alone takes up about half of the pay increase, and we all know that premium goes up each year. So, it’s a little better than a break-even offer, and since this is the only offer I’ve had since I was told I was being laid off, the decision is fairly obvious.

We haven’t had our usual pizza delivery in well over a month. Tonight we broke that streak and feasted on gourmet pizza. Am I celebrating: I guess so. Do I _feel_ celebratory: not really. It’s one of my faults that I was hoping for a much better offer and I’m a little bummed it didn’t happen. I should feel shame: I have a job offer and it pays more than my previous job. I was hoping for fantastic; instead, God gave me better than good.[^1] I should be grateful, but I suspect Pride and Avarice are whispering in my ear. I should ignore those two.

[^1]: What does it say about a man who measures what God did and says it falls short? It says I still have growing to do, and I'm not as humble as I ought. If God declared this good, who am I to argue?
